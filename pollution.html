solution of pollution ?<br>
<br>
One strategy is "in-process recycling". ... The most widespread strategy is "reduction at the source", which is the idea that byproducts of production can be reduced through efficient and careful use of natural resources. This method reduces the amount of dangerous pollutants present in waste before the waste is released.
